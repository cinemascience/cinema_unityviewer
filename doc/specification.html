		<h1>Meta Database Specification v1.4.3</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			The Cinema Unity Viewer allows for viewing multiple spec-A Cinema databases at the 
			same time in a single 3D space. To do this, the Unity Viewer requires a specially 
			formatted json file, called a meta database, describing which databases are to 
			be used and how they are to be arranged in the 3D space. This document describes 
			the formatting of the meta database file and the function of the various properties 
			that can be defined in it.
			<br>
			<b>Note: </b>While it is possible to load a single database into the Unity Viewer 
			directly from its info.json file, for viewing a single database, it is recommended 
			to create a meta database containing only the single database as it will allow 
			for using some of the special properties which may be necessary for the 
			database to display correctly.
			<br><br>
			An example of a meta database file can be found <a href="exampleDatabase.json">here</a>.
			<br>
			A complete json schema for the meta database can be found <a href="schema.json">here</a>.

		<h2>Properties</h2>
			<h3>Root</h3>
				<b>metadata:</b> An object containing properties outside of a specific 
				database (e.g. The boundaries of the viewing area). See "metadata" for more 
				information.
				<br>
				<b>runs:</b> An array of objects representing the databases to be used. 
				See "databases" for more information.
			<h3>metadata</h3>
				<b>minBounds:</b> An array of three numbers representing the smallest 
				values on the x, y, and z axes, respectively, that the camera can move to. 
				In the viewer, walls will appear to block the user as the camera approaches 
				these values.
				<br>
				<b>maxBounds:</b> An array of three numbers representing the largest 
				values on the x, y, and z axes, respectively, that the camera can move to. 
				It is recommended to leave a space of at least ten units around the 
				outermost databases before the boundaries so that the user will have room to 
				easily navigate around them.
				<br>
				<b>maxCacheSize:</b> The maximum number of images each database can 
				store in its cache. The higher this is, the better the performance, but the 
				greater the memory cost.
				<br>
				<b>scale:</b> <i>(optional)</i> Multiplies the positions of all 
				runs by this amount. This will <i>not</i> affect the positions of the 
				boundaries defined in minBounds and maxBounds.
			<h3>runs</h3>
				Any of the properties here can also be placed under "metadata" to act as a default.
				All runs will use the value in "metadata" unless overriden here.
				<br><br>
				<b>path:</b> The path (relative to the meta database file, unless it 
				is an online URL) to the directory containing the database. The database's 
				info.json file must be in this directory. <b>NOTE:</b> It may be necessary to
				alter the direction of the slash in the path according to your system.
				<br>
				<b>position:</b> An array of three numbers representing the position 
				on the x, y, and z axes, respectively where the databases should be in 
				the 3D space. For reference, the camera begins at [0,0,-5] facing 
				the positive Z axis.
				<br>
				<b>size:</b> The size (in pixels per Unity unit) at which the 
				images of the database will be displayed. A smaller value will make 
				the database appear larger.
				<br>
				<b>online:</b> <i>(optional)</i> Whether or not the given path 
				is an online URL.
				<br>
				<b>alphaColor:</b> <i>(optional)</i> An array of three numbers 
				representing the rgb values of the background color to be removed from 
				the image. Rgb values are floats ranging from 0 to 1.0.
				<br>
				<b>alphaThreshold:</b> <i>(optional)</i> The threshold around 
				the alphaColor for removing the background color. A value of 0 means that 
				only pixels exactly matching the alphaColor will be removed. A higher value 
				will remove more similar colors.
				<br>
				<b>alphaSoftness:</b> <i>(optional)</i> Allows for some softness 
				on removing the background. The greater the value, 
				the more colors around the threshold will be given a partial alpha value.
		<h2>Realigning and Rescaling Phi and Theta Values</h2>
			Because different Cinema databases have different ways of interpreting the 
			phi and theta values representing the angles at which the database can be viewed, 
			a number of other properties may be needed to re-interpret these 
			values so that all databases behave properly when put into the 3D space. 
			The properties invertPhi, invertTheta, phiAlignment, thetaAlignment, 
			minPhi, maxPhi, minTheta and maxTheta are used to do this. 
			It is easiest to think to of this process as a pipeline beginning with 
			the phi and theta values of the database in Unity world space. These values are 
			adjusted and, at the end, are matched to the closest values in the ‘phi’ and 
			‘theta’ arguments of the Cinema database to determine which image to display. 
			The steps of that pipeline are outlined below. Like the properties under "runs",
			these values can also be set under "metadata" to act as a default.
			<h3>Beginning</h3>
				At first, the phi and theta variables represent the rotation of the database 
				in Unity world space necessary to face directly at the camera. Phi, 
				the horizontal rotation, starts with 0° facing down the negative Z axis and 
				rotates clockwise up to 360°. Theta, the vertical rotation starts with 0° 
				facing directly downwards (negative Y axis) and 180° facing directly upwards 
				(positive Y axis). For reference, a database placed at [0,0,0] will start 
				with a phi of 0° and theta of 90° as it is directly in front of the camera 
				which starts at [0,0,-5].
			<h3>Inverting Phi/Theta</h3>
				If you find that a database seems to rotate in the wrong direction when moving 
				the camera around it, you may want to invert either the phi or theta values. 
				Setting invertPhi to ‘true’ in the json file will cause the phi value to 
				rotate counter-clockwise instead. For example, a value of 315° will 
				change to 45° when inverted. Likewise, theta will be inverted so that 0° 
				is straight up and 180° is straight down.
			<h3>Phi and Theta Alignment</h3>
				The phiAlignment and thetaAlignment values are added to the phi and theta 
				values respectively. (Both also have a modulo 360, so values above 360° 
				will automatically wrap around). This can be used to effectively rotate 
				an entire database by some amount.
			<b>Note:</b> These values are applied after invertPhi and invertTheta, 
			so a phiAlignment with a value of 90 will rotate in the opposite direction if 
			invertPhi is also true.
			<h3>Rescaling Phi and Theta</h3>
				Sometimes a Cinema database will have phi or theta values that are scaled 
				incorrectly (for example, phi changing by 60° shows a rotation of only 30°). 
				The minPhi, maxPhi, minTheta and maxTheta values can be used to correct scaling 
				problems.  minPhi and minTheta define the Unity world space 
				(after inverting and alignment) equivalents of the first value listed in the 
				database’s phi and theta arguments respectively. Likewise, maxPhi and maxTheta 
				represent the equivalents of the last value listed in the database’s phi and theta 
				arguments. The phi and theta values are then interpolated linearly between 
				these values to ensure they align with what is defined in the database’s arguments.
			<h3>End</h3>
				After the phi and theta values have been inverted, re-aligned and/or rescaled, 
				they are matched to the nearest values defined in the database’s phi and 
				theta arguments. It is these values that are used to determine which image 
				should be displayed.
